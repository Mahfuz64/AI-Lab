Problem:
You are given a 2D grid representing a maze, where each cell is either an empty space (0) or a wall (1). Your task is to implement a Python program that uses Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) to determine whether a valid path exists from a given start cell to a specified target cell. You may move up, down, left, or right to adjacent empty cells, but you cannot pass through walls, and each cell may be visited only once during a single path exploration.
